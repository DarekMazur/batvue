# BatVue

Again - very nostalgic project. BatQuiz was my first js app, so since then most of my training projects based on it - like this one, created just to learn VueJS.

You won't find here anything brilliant - of course if your goal is not only check your knowledge about Gotham Knight :)

## Requires
In this project I'm using:
- node 18.14.0
- npm 9.3.1


## How to run

BatVue is based on Vue (what is quite obvious) and Vite. To run it you need to install project (in console):

`npm install`

`npm run dev` to run local server or `npm run build` to prepare production version.


Good luck during quiz :)
